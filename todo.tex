\specialchapt{TO DO}

List of stuff to do

\begin{itemize}
\item Write abstract
\item Choose and add filter images for each block
\item Create example confusion matrix (iris data? random forest?)
\item Type out back prop equations
\item Mention effect of unequal classs weights and how it was addressed (in ch1, since already in ch3)
\item Look over introduction/description of VGG16 in ch2 for cohesiveness
\item Update confmat in ch3 to use EER instead of solid cutoff (if possible, may need Susan's help)
\item Write up model consistency sections
\item Pick heatmap examples and write about them (I really like the text one from Susan's job talk)
\end{itemize}
