	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a form of deep learning that use complex networks of hidden layers to learn and combine local patterns in a set of training images and detect the presence of similar features in new images. Shoe prints are well-suited to classification with CNNs as they often contain distinct and well-defined shapes, such as circles and triangles, as well as text and textures. Once the shapes contained in a print are detected and classified, the resulting labels can be combined to determine the shoeâ€™s category (e.g., athletic, formal) and brand. This automatic classification can be used to speed up database searches for a given shoe print, and can also be used to determine the relative frequency with which certain characteristics appear in shoes that are commonly worn within specific populations. Using approximately 2000 images of shoe soles of various types, brands, and sizes, our model can successfully identify several different class characteristics with accuracy around 95%.
